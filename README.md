DiscrepancyCorrelations

This project will study the discrepancy between fitted model output and experimental data, and how this discrepancy relates to model variables, fluxes and parameter sensitivities. We use the data and Hodgkin-Huxley model produced by Beattie et al (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/31/100677)
